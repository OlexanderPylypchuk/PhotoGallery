# PhotoGallery
<h2>What is PhotoGallery?</h2>
<p>PhotoGallery is a small, 3 day project. I was hurrying, so React project is still half done and will be updated in the future</p>
<h2>Backend project</h2>
<p>Backend project is simple api with bearer authorization that has all CRUD functionality for uploading photos, adding them to galleries and so on. You can use swagger to easily explore endpoints.</p>
<h2>React project (unfinished)</h2>
<p>As I said, it is not yet finished, but will recieve updates as soon as possible. for now it has some functionality to login, view photos and add photos and galleries. Also it has all endpoints to API setup, so thats nice.</p>
<h2>Tests</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I did not have time to put tests into backend project, but I will, using Moq to mock endpoints.</p>
<h3>Thats it for now, bye!</h3>
